A few words about me

#intro
Frontend Developer based in Iran

With a solid background in web development and telecommunications, I have honed my skills in building robust, high-performance applications and specialize in using Vue.js and Nuxt.js. My work is driven by a passion for creating responsive, SEO-friendly, and user-focused digital experiences that align with client goals.

My projects include developing custom components, optimizing performance, and maintaining a strong focus on detail, which has earned me a reputation for delivering efficient, scalable solutions. I actively engage in learning new technologies, exploring fields such as AI, backend development, and cybersecurity, and am always keen to expand my expertise.
